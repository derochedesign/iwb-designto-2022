The effects of these risks can be felt right <OutLink link={"https://www.cbc.ca/news2/interactives/inourbackyard/"}>here in Toronto.</OutLink> Extreme heat in dense urban centers causes increasing health risks and even fatalities. Greater flooding along Lake Ontario causes home damage and loss. Without necessary interventions to mitigate or adapt to these risks, residents of Canada will face similar situations to climate migrants. Designing climate ready communities today means designing for what climate migrants will require years down the line. Climate action must be implemented at multiple scales so that communities are best equipped to handle environmental risk that threatens peoples’ homes, livelihoods, and lives.</p>
