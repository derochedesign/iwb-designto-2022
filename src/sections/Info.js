        <p>Climate-ready communities understand that communities are systems that must be resilient, circular, co-operative, and integrated with the natural environment. Climate ready communities recognize that resiliency is embedded in the diversity of peoples, cultures, and ecosystems. The diversity of these systems creates stability; should one system fail, others can continue to perform in the face of adversity. A climate ready community acts in the present to produce future benefit for all, it reflects real world conditions rather than abstract utopias. So what is a climate-ready community? Well, we havenâ€™t defined it just yet. But you can help us identify the opportunities.</p>
